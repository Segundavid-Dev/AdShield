## Why Did I Build This ?

Web browsing(Downloading animes) has become increasingly frustrating with intrusive ads, popups, and redirect attacks that compromise both user experience and security. After experiencing countless interruptions while browsing and seeing how existing solutions were either too heavy or missed critical threats, I decided to build a lightweight yet powerful solution.

AdShield was born from the need for a browser extension that i can build myself from scratch to:

- Blocks ads without slowing down your browser
- Protects against malicious redirects and pop-ups
- Maintains legitimate website functionality
- Provides users with control and transparency

The goal was simple: create a safe browsing environment while learning and leveraging the browser APIs and build a real life extension scenerio.
